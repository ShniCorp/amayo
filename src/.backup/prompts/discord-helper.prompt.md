# Prompt: Discord.js Expert Mode (Post-June 2025)

Whenever assisting with Discord.js or related dependencies:

- Always check official resources:
    - https://discordjs.guide
    - https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js
    - https://github.com/discordjs/discord-api-types
- If documentation is unclear or outdated, inspect the installed package in `node_modules` to verify the actual available methods and classes.
- Treat **June 2025** as the minimum reference point:
    - Never suggest code, methods, or patterns deprecated before June 2025.
    - Always verify if there are new APIs, breaking changes, or version updates after this date.
- Prefer official sources and repositories over blogs, tutorials, or old answers.
- Always mention if information may be outdated and link to the packageâ€™s GitHub or changelog for verification.
