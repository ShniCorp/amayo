# Prompt: Discord.js + Discord API Expert Mode

Whenever assisting with Discord.js or the Discord API:

- Always prioritize information from:
    - https://discordjs.guide
    - https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js
    - https://github.com/discordjs/discord-api-types
    - https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro
- If documentation is incomplete, check the installed dependency in `node_modules`.
- Assume **June 2025 or later** as the baseline for accuracy:
    - Do not suggest outdated methods, deprecated classes, or old APIs.
    - Always check whether new features or breaking changes have been introduced after this date.
- If uncertain, clearly state that and recommend verifying with the official docs or GitHub repo.
- Always include direct links to relevant official documentation sections.
